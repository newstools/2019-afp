Max Verstappen was stripped of pole position for the Mexican Grand Prix on Saturday after being slapped with a three-place grid penalty, race officials confirmed. The Dutch Red Bull driver was sanctioned for not slowing down sufficiently following a horror crash involving Valtteri Bottas near the end of Saturday's qualifying. Verstappen's penalty means Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start on pole for Sunday's race ahead of team-mate Sebastian Vettel.
