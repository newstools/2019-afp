Pau's two-time Rugby World Cup winner Colin Slade will be rested for three months after suffering a third concussion in the space of a year in accordance with Top 14 rules, the French club said on Monday. Slade, 32, suffered the blow in the defeat to Lyon on October 12, after having sustained earlier head injuries during pre-season and on Ocober 27 last year in a loss to Racing 92. "The health and well-being of the player was given the highest priority," the side said in a statement. "The rugby and medical staff at Pau will all pay particular attention to his recovery before allowing him to get back to his best level," it added. The league rules state a player must stop playing for three months after suffering a third concussion in 12 months and can only return to action after an evalution from two experts. Pau sit in eighth place in the table with four wins from their opening eight games of the season. The All Blacks' Ben Smith, who has also suffered from concussion injuries during his career, will join the club at the end of the ongoing World Cup as well as seven-time New Zealand international Luke Whitelock who is yet to finish the Mitre 10 Cup campaign with Canterbury.
