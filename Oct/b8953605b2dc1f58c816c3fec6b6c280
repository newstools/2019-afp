French international full-back Thomas Ramos, who was sent home from the World Cup with what was judged to be a tournament-ending ankle injury, used his "desire and frustration" to help Toulouse to victory in the Top 14 on Saturday. Ramos was injured during France's 33-9 win over the United States on October 2 and subsequently ruled out of the remainder of the World Cup in Japan where Les Bleus have since reached the quarter-finals. However, on Saturday, he played the full 80 minutes, seemingly with no ill-effects as Toulouse swept to a 36-15 win over Castres. "He had a lot of desire and a lot of frustration," said Toulouse backs coach Clement Poitrenaud. "When you have a player of his level and he is available, then you do not ask yourself if he should be playing or not." Ramos was happy to enjoy a low-key return to the starting line-up. Despite being his club's top scorer from last season, he ceded kicking duties to Australian teammate Zack Holmes who booted 21 points, including converting his team's three tries. Saturday's win was the third of the Top 14 season for 20-time champions Toulouse, who had started the weekend second from bottom of the table but are now fifth. Lyon stay top thanks to a 27-8 win over Pau that allowed them to claim a seventh win in seven games. Promoted Bayonne are third following a 28-24 win over Montpellier, the Basques' fifth victory in seven games. La Rochelle celebrated a 50th straight sold-out home league match by running in five tries to beat Brive 41-17. Racing 92's woes continued when a 27-27 draw with Agen left Laurent Travers's side with a record of just one home win in four outings at their La Defense Arena. Racing could have won it with the game's last piece of meaningful action but Sam Hidalgo-Clyne's ambitious 50-metre penalty attempt sailed wide.
