RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner became the latest player to be ruled out of Germany's friendly with Argentina, prompting coach Joachim Loew to call for reinforcements on Monday. Loew added Hoffenheim midfielder Sebastian Rudy and uncapped Freiburg defender Robin Koch to the squad that will host Argentina on Wednesday and then travel to Estonia for a Euro 2020 qualifier four days later. "I spent my Sunday on the phone and I didn't receive anything but bad news," said Loew, who will also be without injured midfielder Ilkay Gundogan for the friendly in Dortmund. Toni Kroos, Jonas Hector and Matthias Ginter all withdrew from the squad on Sunday, with Schalke's Suat Serdar summoned as cover. Loew is missing a dozen regulars with Manchester City's Leroy Sane a notable long-term absentee after he tore knee ligaments in August. "It's a pity because our young team needs to settle in if it wants to make progress," Loew said. "It hurts us, it's unusually hard for us. These aren't the best conditions but I'm not going to whine about it. It also gives a chance to others and to young players." Loew said he had not comtemplated recalling Mats Hummels from his international exile after omitting the Borussia Dortmund defender in March. "I haven't thought about him. We're following our path with our young players and there's no reason to call up Mats." Loew has selected five uncapped players with Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Nadiem Amiri, Freiburg forward Luca Waldschmidt and Hertha Berlin defender Niklas Stark joining Koch and Serdar. Germany are level on 12 points from five matches with Northern Ireland at the top of Group C. The Netherlands, who beat Germany 4-2 in Hamburg last month, are three points behind with a game in hand. The top two sides will qualify automatically for Euro 2020.
