Juventus midfielder Aaron Ramsey will miss Wales' Euro 2020 qualifier against Slovakia this week as he recovers from a muscle injury, the Football Association of Wales (FAW) said on Wednesday. Ramsey suffered the groin problem while warming up at half-time during Juventus' 2-1 win at Inter Milan on Sunday. Juventus manager Maurizio Sari said Ramsey, who did not feature against Inter, had felt "a twinge" during the substitutes' practice session. He trained with the rest of the Wales squad on Tuesday and Wednesday, but will not be risked in Slovakia on Thursday. "Aaron Ramsey has stayed behind in Cardiff to regain fitness for Sunday's game against Croatia," the FAW said in a tweet. Ramsey has not played for his country for almost a year, with his last appearance coming in a friendly against Albania in November 2018. Wales are currently fourth in Group E as they battle to qualify for Euro 2020. Ryan Giggs' side have won two and lost two, trailing leaders Croatia by four points, as well as second and third placed Slovakia and Hungary by three points with a game in hand on all of them. "Aaron felt a bit of tightness in his adductor. He trained today and we're hopeful he'll play on Sunday," Giggs said.
