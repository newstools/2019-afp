A Hussein el Shahat hat-trick helped Al Ahly of Egypt overwhelm Atlabara of South Sudan 9-0 Friday and equal the record for a CAF Champions League aggregate winning margin. The Cairo Red Devils won the preliminary tie 13-0 overall to match the margin achieved by Young Africans of Tanzania 10 years ago. Ahly had the benefit of playing both legs in Egyptian Mediterranean city Alexandria because the national stadium in South Sudan capital Juba is being renovated. Already four goals ahead from the first leg, record eight-time African champions Ahly scored four in the first half of the second leg with Salah Mohsen bagging a brace. El Shahat notched the second of his three goal a minute into the second half and a miserable night for Atlabara was completed when Mostafa Selim conceded an own goal nine minutes from time. Meanwhile, Cote d'Or became the first club from the Indian Ocean island of the Seychelles to win a Champions League tie since 2004 when they drew 1-1 at home against Fomboni of the Comoros. The Seychellois advanced on away goals having drawn 2-2 in the Comoros two weekends ago and could face 2016 champions Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa in the round of 32. Sundowns host AS Otoho of Congo Brazzaville in Pretoria Saturday having lost the first leg 2-1 in central Africa. In Uganda, late goals from Mustafa Kizza and Allan Okello gave hosts Kampala Capital City Authority a 2-0 win over African Stars of Namibia and a tougher than expected passage to the next round. Stars won the first leg 3-2 in Windhoek and contained the Ugandans for 81 minutes before Kizza scored direct from a free kick. Okello slammed a Mike Mutyaba pass into the net a minute from time to seal a 4-3 aggregate victory for the Kampala outfit.
