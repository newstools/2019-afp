Dallas Cowboys defensive end Robert Quinn was suspended for next month's first two games of the NFL season by the league on Thursday for violating the NFL performance-enhancing substances policy. Quinn, who suffered a broken left hand in pre-season practice on Tuesday in Southern California, tested positive for a masking agent. He will miss Cowboys' contests against a pair of NFC East division rivals, the New York Giants and Washington Redskins. But Quinn will return in time for his first game to be against Miami, the same club that traded him to the Cowboys for a sixth-round NFL draft pick in the off-season. The 29-year-old defender played seven seasons for the St. Louis-Los Angeles Rams before joining the Dolphins in 2018. He had 6.5 quarterback sacks, 15 quarterback hits, two forced fumbles and 38 tackles last season. In eight NFL seasons, Quinn has 256 tackles, 69 sacks, 22 forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries. Quinn's agent, Steve Kiernan, defended his client in a statement, saying the NFL veteran has a history of seizures that forces him to take medication for which he tested positive. "Rob has a medical history with seizures that requires him to take multiple doses of preventative medication daily to regulate them," Kiernan said in the statement. "I've been working with NFL players for 20 years, and I can't think of a situation where I've been personally involved where the league was as tone deaf as it was here. "Rob will be punished for something that would have been impossible for him to prevent."
