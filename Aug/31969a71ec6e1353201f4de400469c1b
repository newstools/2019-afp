The Pro Bowl, the NFL's annual game between American and National conference all-stars a week before the Super Bowl, will return to Orlando, Florida, in 2020, the league announced Wednesday. The matchup will be staged January 26 at Orlando, which hosts for the fourth consecutive year. "We're happy to provide not only a week-long celebration of football, but also to extend the celebration of the NFL's 100th season throughout this year's Pro Bowl," said Peter O'Reilly, NFL executive vice president of league events. The game had been staged at Aloha Stadium in Honolulu from 1979 through 2015 except for 2009 in Miami and 2014 in Glendale, Arizona. The American Conference has won all three Pro Bowl contests staged in Orlando since leaving Hawaii, including a 26-7 triumph last year sparked by Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes. Super Bowl participants do not take part in the contest, but for some stars who fail to make the title game it provides a relaxing week with peers and family as a cap to the campaign.
