Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend's pleasure at beating France at the weekend was  dulled on Tuesday by the news that lock Sam Skinner has been ruled out of the World Cup. The 24-year-old England-born second row forward, who has been outstanding for English Premiership giants Exeter Chiefs, suffered a hamstring injury in the 17-14 win over the French. "Skinner had the muscle scanned on the evening of the match, with the time taken to recover deemed insufficient to play a meaningful part in Scotlandâ€™s Rugby World Cup 2019 campaign," read a statement from the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU). The experienced Tim Swinson will join up with the training group as cover. The 32-year-old has played in 38 Tests, the most recent against Argentina in June 2018, and is also able to play in the back row. Swinson, who was also born in England, has been preferred to Toulouse lock and former British and Irish Lion Richie Gray, who played the last of his 65 Tests against Italy in March 2018. The Scots have a double header with Georgia to come beginning in Tblisi this Saturday. Townsend names his final squad on September 3. pi/bsp
