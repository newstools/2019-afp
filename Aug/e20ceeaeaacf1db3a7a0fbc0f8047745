Alejandro Valverde won a heavyweight brawl to take victory at the top of the Mas de la Costas climb on Friday while Miguel Angel Lopez finished third to retake the overall lead. The 183.2km stage from Onda ended with a brief but brutal 4.1km climb which quickly split the pack. With three kilometres to go, Nairo Quintana accelerated and was followed by only Movistar team-mate Valverde, Primoz Roglic of Jumbo-Visma and Astana's Lopez. Uran, a Colombian, set the pace until the final kilometre, creating the springboard for his Spanish team-mate. Valverde, riding his home tour wearing the world champion's rainbow jersey, charged for the line in the final metres, chased home by Slovenian Roglic. "A short but sweet climb and we know Valverde is good at this," Roglic told Eurosport. Lopez rolled in six seconds later, expending less energy but still ensuring he regained the overall lead from Belgian Dylan Teuns, who struggled on the climbs. Quintana was fourth having also done his job for his team. The four men in the breakaway lead the overall standings. Lopez is six seconds ahead of Roglic with the 39-year-old Valverde 16 back and Quintana at 27. "I'm happy with my second place," said Roglic. Both the Movistar men have won the Vuelta, Quintana in 2016 and Valverde in 2009, the year before he was banned for two years for doping. In a race so far marked by breakaways, Saturday's eighth stage is a hilly 166.9km ride from Valls to Igualada where the flat finish could give the sprinters a chance, if the pack stays together.
