Estonian driver Ott Tanak moved a step closer to the World Rally Championship title by winning the Rally of Germany for a third consecutive year on Sunday. Toyota driver Tanak, 31, led from the front for almost all of the 19-stage rally in Germany's Mosel valley this weekend, and comfortably wrapped up the overall victory despite not winning any of Sunday's four stages. He is now 35 points clear of Belgian Hyundai driver Thierry Neuville at the top of the championship standings, and looks well on course to unseat perennial world champion Sebastien Ogier at the end of the season. Tanak held a narrow lead over Neuville after the vineyard road stages on Friday, before building up a significant advantage during Saturday's stages on the daunting 'Panzerplatte' tank training tracks at the Baumholder military base. Tanak profited from his rivals' misfortunes, as Neuville suffered a puncture early on Saturday, while Ogier had problems with his Citroen C3 car throughout the weekend. "I can do absolutely nothing. The stage is fine for me but I can not drive this car," said Ogier, who finished in a distant eighth. The Frenchman, who has held the world title since 2013, looks ever more likely to surrender his crown this year, with just four events left in the season. If Tanak does end Ogier's six-year hegemony, he would become the first non-French world champion since 2003. Standings: 1. Ott Tanak-Martin Jarveoja (EST/Toyota Yaris) 3h15:29.8, 2.
