It took two weeks to complete, but the Boston Red Sox were in no mood to keep their fans waiting. The World Series champions needed just 12 minutes on Thursday to complete a 5-4 extra inning victory over the Kansas City Royals at Fenway Park. The conclusion of the game had been delayed since August 7, when heavy rain ended play with the score locked at 4-4 in the 10th inning. When play finally resumed in bright sunshine on Thursday at Fenway, the Red Sox wrapped up victory in a hurry. Brock Holt's walk-off single to left field off of Richard Lovelady sealed the win. "We were trying to end it as quick as we could," said Holt afterwards. "Losing an off-day to be here to finish this game, we've got a long flight to San Diego, we wanted to end it as quick as possible. "It was probably the best outcome that we could have had today, I think, a 12-minute game, so we'll take it." The game was played out before a large crowd. Children were granted free admission, while adult tickets were on sale for a mere $5, with all the proceeds going to the Jimmy Fund cancer charity. Red Sox third-base coach Carlos Febles said it was "the best crowd we had the whole year." "They were into the game. They were loud. That's what you need," Febles said. "It's awesome for the players. The players were excited to have so many kids in the stands."
