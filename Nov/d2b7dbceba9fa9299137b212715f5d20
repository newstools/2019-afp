A century stand between Asghar Afghan and Mohammad Nabi lifted Afghanistan to 249 for seven in the third one-day international against West Indies on Monday. Afghan, who made 86, put on 127 runs with Nabi, 50 not out, for the sixth wicket after Afghanistan slipped to 118-5 in Lucknow. The West Indies, who have an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, won the toss and put Afghanistan in to bat. Paceman Keemo Paul claimed three wickets to rattle the Afghanistan top-order despite left-handed opener Hazratullah Zazai recording his second T20 fifty. Hazratullah became Paul's third victim after top-edging a short delivery to deep mid-wicket for 50. Afghan then took stock to re-build the innings at Afghanistan's adopted home in Lucknow. India has been the home of the war-torn nation's cricket team since 2015. Nabi joined forces and the batting pair took the attack to the opposition, with some attacking shots in the final half of the innings. Afghan finally fell to paceman Alzarri Joseph after smashing three fours and six sixes in his 85-ball knock. Nabi, who hit three fours and a six in his 66-ball stay, raised his 15th ODI fifty on the penultimate ball of the innings as Afghanistan managed 54 runs from the last five overs.
