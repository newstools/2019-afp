Opener Rohit Sharma had an early reprieve as India made a strong start after electing to bat first against Bangladesh in the World Cup at Edgbaston on Tuesday. Sharma started with a six in the first over but mistimed a pull off paceman Mustafizur Rahman only for Tamim Iqbal to drop a simple catch at deep mid-wicket with the batsman on nine. Sharma, who scored a century in India's first World Cup defeat to hosts England on Sunday, hit another two sixes and four fours as India reached 87-0 at the end of 15 overs. Sharma was unbeaten on 51 while KL Rahul was 32 not out. Rahul took inspiration from his opening partner to hit two glorious boundaries off Bangladesh quick Mohammad Saifuddin and contribute to the brisk start. Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza rotated his three quicks but could not force a breakthrough. A win for Virat Kohli's India would ensure a semi-final spot in the 10-team event. Bangladesh need to win both of their final fixtures, against India and Pakistan, and hope results elsewhere go in their favour.
