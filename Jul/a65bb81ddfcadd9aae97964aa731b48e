Jim Herman rolled in two eagle putts in a 10-under par 62 on Saturday to maintain a one-shot lead heading into the final round of the US PGA Tour Barbasol Championship in Kentucky. Herman, a former assistant pro at Trump National Bedminster in New Jersey, said this week that advice from US President Donald Trump during a round this month had spurred him to make putting changes that were paying off this week. And he said the president called him to offer encouragement heading into the weekend of the tournament played opposite the British Open at Portrush. "Pretty interesting getting a phone call from the president," said Herman, whose 24-under par total of 192 put him one stroke in front of Kelly Kraft. Austin Cook fired a 63 to share third place on 196 with Bill Haas, who carded a 65 at Keene Trace Golf Club in Nicholasville, Kentucky. Herman, seeking a second PGA Tour title to go with the Houston Open trophy he claimed in 2016, rolled in an eagle putt of 11 feet at the eighth and drained a 10-footer for eagle at 15. He added six birdies in a bogey-free effort. Kraft rolled in a 64-foot eagle putt at the 15th to go with nine birdies -- including a 15-footer at the last.
