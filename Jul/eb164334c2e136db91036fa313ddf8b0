North Korea's anti-doping committee has been removed from the list of nations deemed non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Code, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) announced Friday. The move came after a WADA executive committee vote following a recommendation from WADA's compliance review committee. North Korea had been given four months by WADA last September to correct issues related to its testing program and WADA found them non-compliant in January. Since then, North Korean anti-doping officials, in cooperation with the Chinese Anti-Doping Agency, have started corrective measures to address the problems, WADA said. North Korea's Anti-Doping Committee continues to work with China's Anti-Doping Agency to further enhance its program, according to WADA. No exact reasons for the non-compliance were revealed.
