Former champion Jordan Spieth charged into a share of the British Open lead with his fellow American J.B. Holmes early in Friday's second round at Royal Portrush. Three-time major winner Spieth, who has struggled in the last 18 months and slipped to 38th in the world rankings, followed back-to-back birdies with an eagle at the par-five seventh hole to reach five-under par for the tournament. He poured in another long putt for birdie on the eighth to put his name at the top of the leaderboard. Overnight leader Holmes made an early birdie of his own to edge to six-under after his opening round of 66. World number one Brooks Koepka was even-par for the day through nine holes, three-under for the tournament. Further back on the course, Tiger Woods holed a 30-foot birdie putt as he made the perfect start in his bid to make the cut after a miserable first-round 78.
