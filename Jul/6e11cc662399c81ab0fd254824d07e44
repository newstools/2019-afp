Sean McVay, who coached the Los Angeles Rams to their first Super Bowl appearance in 17 years, has signed a five-year contract extension with the NFL club, the team announced Friday. McVay has gone 24-8 in two seasons guiding the Rams, delivering their first playoff berth since 2004 in the 2017 season and into the championship game of the 2018 campaign, falling 10-3 to New England this past February. "I'm very thankful to be a Ram for many years to come," McVay said. The Rams open training camp this week for the league's 100th season hoping to take the final step and capture their first NFL crown since winning the 2000 Super Bowl while based in St. Louis. McVay, 33, is signed through the 2023 campaign and with the team moving into a new stadium next year should help stabilize the Rams' recent success. The new deal replaces the final three years McVay had on the contract his signed with the Rams in January 2017 at age 30 as the youngest coach in modern NFL history after serving as offensive coordinator for the Washington Redskins. Rams general manager Les Snead's contract was also extended through 2023. McVay took over a Rams squad that went 4-12 and guided it to an 11-5 mark, the first winning season since 2003, and the NFC West division title thanks largely to an offensive revamp that had the Rams lead the NFL in scoring behind quarterback Jared Goff. Following up an NFL Coach of the Year season, McVay directed the Rams to a 13-3 record last year and two playoff wins before a dramatic Super Bowl loss to the Patriots.
