Washington quarterback Alex Smith's recovery from a gruesome injury has progressed with the removal of the "external fixator" brace that had supported his right leg since he broke two bones in an NFL game eight months ago. Smith's wife, Elizabeth, posted a picture on Instagram that showed Smith holding up the large, circular brace which fit around his lower leg. The Redskins re-posted the picture on Twitter with the caption "The brace is off! A great step for Alex in his recovery." Elizabeth Smith called it "a big milestone". "We are shedding the weight Alex has been carrying (literally and figuratively). It's one step closer to the goal." Smith underwent multiple surgeries and post-operative complications after he was hurt in the third quarter of a November 18 game against the Houston Texans, his leg buckling awkwardly underneath him as he was sacked. Smith attended Washington's "organized team activities" workout in May, where he was photographed throwing a football. Although he is not expected to be able to play in the upcoming NFL season, he has said returning to the league is his ultimate goal. The Redskins will begin training camp on July 25 with first-round draft pick Dwayne Haskins and veterans Case Keenum and Colt McCoy vying for the starting quarterback position.
