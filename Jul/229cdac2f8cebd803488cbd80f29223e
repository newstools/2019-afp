India suffered a stunning top-order slump as they collapsed to five for three in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand at Old Trafford on Wednesday. Set a seemingly modest target of 240 for victory, India saw key batsmen Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and KL Rahul all depart for one run each as Trent Boult and Matt Henry made a blistering start with the new ball. Sharma had come into this match having made five hundreds this tournament, a record for a single World Cup. But the opener fell for just one when he edged a fine Henry delivery that curved away to wicketkeeper Tom Latham. India captain Kohli went next, lbw to a superb inswinger from left-armer Boult. Kohli reviewed but replays upheld English official Richard Illingworth's original out decision on umpire's call and, to the despair of the massed ranks of India fans in the ground, the star batsman had to go. India were then 5-3 when Rahul was brilliantly caught by a diving Latham following an edge off Henry. At that stage, India, two-time world champions, had lost three wickets for one run in 10 balls against 2015 runners-up New Zealand. Earlier, New Zealand added 28 runs in 23 balls to their overnight score before finishing on 239-8 after rain had stopped play on Tuesday with the Black Caps then 211-5 off 46.1 overs. The winners of this match will face either hosts England or reigning champions Australia, who play at Edgbaston on Thursday, in Sunday's final at Lord's.
