The second women's World Cup semi-final between Sweden and the Netherlands went into extra time on Wednesday after a goalless 90 minutes in Lyon. A disappointing encounter briefly came to life in the second half with both teams hitting the woodwork, a Nilla Fischer shot for Sweden being tipped onto the post before a Vivianne Miedema header at the other end was touched onto the bar. The winner will go through to the final on Sunday against holders the United States, who beat England 2-1 in the first semi-final on Tuesday.
