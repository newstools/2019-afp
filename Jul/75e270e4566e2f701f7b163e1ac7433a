Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones will continue to play his club rugby on home soil after announcing a contract extension till 2021 with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) and the Ospreys on Tuesday. The 33-year-old is the leading appearance holder for the Ospreys with 238 matches and has 125 caps for his country. "After serious consideration and taking stock of all options, it is the right decision for my career at this point in time, along with my personal ambitions on and off the field, my welfare and needs of my family," Wyn Jones said in an online announcement. Wyn Jones is preparing to head to Switzerland as Wales ramp up their training programme for the World Cup and having his future sorted ahead of the showpiece in Japan is a huge boost for the WRU. "Alun Wyn is hugely respected across the game and I'm delighted he has committed his future here in Wales and that he will be continuing to play for his hometown region," Martyn Phillips, Group Chief Executive of the WRU.
