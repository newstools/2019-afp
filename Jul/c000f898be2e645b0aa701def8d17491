Nationals pitcher Max Scherzer went back on the 10-day injured list on injured list Monday with a mild muscle strain in his back, the Major League Baseball club said. Scherzer missed the All-Star game this month with a sore back that began bothering him in late June. He pitched five innings against the Colorado Rockies on Thursday, allowing three runs, but an MRI after that game revealed the rhomboid strain in his upper back. Although the 35-year-old said he hoped to make his scheduled Tuesday start against the Atlanta Braves, Nationals manager Dave Martinez said Sunday the team's priority was to get Scherzer 100 percent healthy. "We need Max to be 100 percent to get us through the next few months," Martinez said. "Regardless of how, he's got to prove to us that he is that." The injury has slowed what looked like becoming a career year for the seven-time All-Star. In nine starts from may 22 to July 6 he went 7-0 with a 0.84 earned run average. Over that span he struck out 94 and walked nine.
