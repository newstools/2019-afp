New events in Japan and Bermuda plus a return for the Greenbrier and Houston Open were named Tuesday as part of an expanded 2019-20 US PGA schedule. The next campaign will include 49 events, three more than the current season, with additions to the early events and some shifts late in the schedule near the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The new season begins September 12-15 at the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia followed by four more US events, including the Houston Open, which like the Greenbrier took a one-year hiatus after a major PGA schedule revamp for this season. A three-week Asian swing follows with the CJ Cup in South Korea, the new Zozo Championship in Japan replacing a previous stop in Malaysia and the WGC HSBC Championship in Shanghai the same week as the new Bermuda Championship at Port Royal in Southampton. The 2019 portion of the season concludes with November stops in Mexico and at the RSM Classic. The tour resumes in January and the nearly the first five months are unchanged before the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit moves from late June to the end of May, adding an event between the PGA Championship and the US Open. The WGC St. Jude Invitational and the PGA's Barracuda Championship, played just last week in the current calendar, shift to July 2-5 while the 3M Open in Minnesota shifts to July 20-26, the week before the Olympic tournament, which ends August 2, and the week after the British Open. After the Olympics comes the PGA Tour season finale August 6-9 at the Wyndham Championship followed by the tour's three season-ending playoff events, culminating with the Tour Championship on August 27-30. "After a very successful first year with our new schedule, we are thrilled to expand the number of events to 49 while maintaining a great flow from start-to-finish," US PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan said.
