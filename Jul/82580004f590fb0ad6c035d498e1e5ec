Fabio Fognini came through a five-set battle to reach the Wimbledon third round -- but next faces a man who also went through the wringer to make the last 32. The Italian 12th seed takes on Tennys Sandgren of the United States on Saturday, who similarly came through a gruelling five-set second round contest. Clay court specialist Fognini is still floating near his highest-ever ranking, having won his first Masters-level title in April. "Fognini's a really good player, very talented. He's had a phenomenal year winning Monte Carlo," Sandgren told AFP. "I've played him twice. One time was 7-6 in the third. He's going to be extremely tough. I'm going to have to play really well if I'm going to even have a shot at sneaking a win." Sandgren claimed the scalp of French 20th seed Gilles Simon in a 6-2, 6-3, 4-6, 3-6, 8-6 win on Thursday. Meanwhile Fognini beat Hungarian Marton Fucsovics 6-7 (7/6), 6-4, 7-6 (7/3), 2-6, 6-3. "I guess that helps me a little bit. Maybe we're both a little tired. It's better than him winning in straight sets!" said world number 94 Sandgren. "I'm definitely spent. I was really hurting by the end of the fourth and probably didn't have any business winning the fifth but got a little lucky. "Definitely running on fumes." Sandgren, a 2018 Australian Open quarter-finalist, made his debut in the Wimbledon main draw last year. "I played Novak Djokovic, so I was done pretty fast!" the US player recalled. "I don't know what to expect coming here. I feel like my game's not bad for grass. My serve's good and I can attack." The winner of the match would face either Sam Querrey of the United States or Australia's John Millman -- both unseeded -- in the fourth round, with Rafael Nadal a potential quarter-final opponent.
