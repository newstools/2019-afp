Joe Marler has come out of retirement to be named in England's Rugby World Cup training squad, while Danny Cipriani has also been included on the 35-man roster that was announced on Thursday. Harlequins prop Marler, 28, last featured for England against South Africa in June 2018 before retiring due to personal reasons, but he has now reversed that decision. Gloucester's Willi Heinz has won the battle for inclusion at scrum-half, with Saracens' Ben Spencer also included, but Wasps' Dan Robson misses out. England boss Eddie Jones said: "I saw Joe during the Barbarians' week and he indicated that he had a desire to come back. "We have since had a couple of chats and we have given him the opportunity to do that. Now it is up to him to show us what he has got. "We can't wait to have the full squad in place and to have players competing for those (final World Cup) 31 places."
