Dallas Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott issued an apology on Tuesday following the altercation at a Las Vegas music festival earlier this year which led to him being briefly detained by police. Elliott, who confirmed he had met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell to address the incident, said in a statement he had made a "poor decision" during the spat where he appeared to shove a security guard. "Earlier today, I met with the Commissioner to share with him what occurred in Las Vegas and what I have learned from that incident," Elliott wrote. "I've worked hard to make better decisions and to live up to the high standards that are expected of me. I failed to do that here and I made a poor decision. "I need to work harder to ensure I do not put myself in compromised situations in the future. I am rededicating myself to use all of the resources the league has made available. "But in the end, it is up to me and I am determined not to be in this position again." Elliott was handcuffed but later released without being formally arrested or charged following the incident in May at the Las Vegas Electric Daisy music festival. Video footage of the confrontation showed Elliott appearing to use his forearm to push the security guard into a metal barrier. The guard then falls to the floor. Elliott is walking a disciplinary tightrope with the NFL, who suspended the running back for six games in 2017 for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy. The suspension related to allegations of domestic violence made by an ex-girlfriend on five separate occasions in 2016. Elliott, 23, is one of the best running backs in the NFL rushing for more than 4,000 yards in his first three seasons and earning Pro Bowl selections in 2016 and 2018.
