New Zealand equestrian Mark Todd announced his retirement from eventing Monday after a storied career that included two Olympic gold medals and appearances at seven Games. Todd, 63, said he was leaving the sport to concentrate on training racehorses. Named the International Equestrian Federation's rider of the century in 2000, Todd won back-to-back golds in individual eventing at the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. The rider, who noted at the Rio Games that he was now competing against the children of his contemporaries, said he no longer had the competitive drive to win at eventing. "I had initially thought I may stay on for one more Olympic Games but ... unless you are 110 percent focused and driven towards that goal, you won't succeed," he said in a statement. Todd left the sport on a winning note, announcing his retirement after his New Zealand team claimed the Nations' Cup at the Camphire International Horse Trials in Ireland.
