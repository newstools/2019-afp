Houston Astros right-hander Justin Verlander and in-form Los Angeles Dodgers ace Hyun-Jin Ryu will face off after being named as the starting pitchers in for baseball's All-Star Game, the league announced on Monday. Verlander, who helped the Astros to victory over the Dodgers in the 2017 World Series, heads a formidable pitching line-up for the American League side who will take to the field in Cleveland on Tuesday. New York Yankees' Japanese star Masahiro Tanaka is expected to relieve Verlander with Yankees team-mate Aroldis Chapman coming on as closer. Verlander comes into the game in red-hot form this season with a 2.98 earned run average (ERA) and 153 strikeouts. However the Dodgers' South Korean lefty Ryu leads the majors with an ERA of 1.73 and will spearhead the National League's line-up. Ryu will be backed from the bullpen by Dodgers team-mate Clayton Kershaw, with New York Mets ace Jacob deGrom to feature as closer. The National League line-up, which is being managed by Dodgers skipper Dave Roberts, also has two of Major League Baseball's hottest hitters in its batting line-up, boasting home run leader Christian Yelich and the Dodgers Cody Bellinger. Yelich leads the majors for homers this season with 31 while Bellinger is tied for second Pete Alonso with 30. The starting line-ups for the All-Star game were decided by fan voting, with the exception of the starting pitchers and designated hitters for each team.
