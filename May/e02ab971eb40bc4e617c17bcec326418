Patrice Bergeron scored two goals on the power play as the Boston Bruins squared their NHL second round playoff series with the Columbus Blue Jackets with a 4-1 victory on Thursday. David Pastrnak finished with a goal and an assist and Sean Kuraly scored a single for the Bruins, who tied the series 2-2. "It's only a matter of time before these guys score goals. You give them that many opportunities every game, they are going to score. They are that good. There is no panic," said Boston forward Brad Marchand, who chipped in with an assist. Boston hosts game five in the best-of-seven series on Saturday. Boston goaltender Tuukka Rask was solid stopping Columbus forward Boone Jenner on a penalty shot, one of 39 saves on the night. "I don't think they got too many rebound opportunities," Rask said. "That's how they've been scoring. They were trying to play down low, pushing more pucks in there but I thought we protected well. That was huge." Boston coach Bruce Cassidy said: "I don't think any team wins without their best players being their best players. We can survive for a while. So far in this series we had." After Artemi Panarin's disputed goal trimmed Boston's lead to 2-1 in the first period, the Bruins scored twice in the third to clinch the victory. Bergeron capped the scoring with a power-play goal from in close with 2:30 left in the game.
