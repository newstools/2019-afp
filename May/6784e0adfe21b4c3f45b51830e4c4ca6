Dave Tippett was named as the new head coach of the Edmonton Oilers on Tuesday following the sacking of predecessor Ken Hitchcock earlier this month. Tippett, 57, will be handed the task of leading the Oilers back to the playoffs after they missed out on the postseason for a second straight year. Tippett has a 14-season career as a head coach in the NHL, with stints at Dallas, Phoenix and Arizona. "Dave brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to the organization," said Edmonton general manager Ken Holland. "He is a great communicator and has consistently led teams known for their level of compete. I look forward to seeing Dave guide the Oilers this fall and we are all excited to have him on board." Tippett parted company with the Arizona Coyotes in 2017 after failing to reach the playoffs for a fifth consecutive year. "I'm well-rested. I've been out for a couple of years and can't wait to get going," Tippett said Tuesday. He had earlier guided the Coyotes to three straight postseason appearances, reaching the Conference Finals in 2011-2012. Prior to his stint in Arizona, the former Canada coach had made the playoffs in five years out of six as head coach of the Dallas Stars.
