Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Julio Urias was reinstated by the franchise on Tuesday, a week after being placed on administrative leave amid a domestic violence probe. Urias, 22, was detained last week on suspicion of misdemeanour domestic battery after an incident in the car park of a Los Angeles shopping mall, with witnesses telling police they saw the pitcher shove a woman. ESPN reported that Major League Baseball's investigation into Urias remained open. Prosecutors in Los Angeles meanwhile have not filed any charges against the pitcher and police have not released a report of the incident. ESPN reported that Urias's reinstatement came after MLB was unable to obtain security footage of the alleged incident. MLB commissioner Rob Manfred had placed Urias on a seven-day administrative leave last week in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement. Urias is a rising star on the Dodgers' pitching staff. The left-hander made his Major League debut with the team when he was 19, building a 5-2 record in 15 starts in 2016. A left shoulder injury in June 2017 sidelined him for more than a year, but he returned late last season and made relief appearances in the regular season and playoffs. He was 2-2 in starts this year before being moved to the bullpen in a bid to limit his innings.
