Steve Smith and David Warner were Monday selected by Australia for the first time since the ball-tampering scandal as the reigning World Cup champions face a New Zealand XI in a practice match. It marks the pair's return to the national fold after serving year-long bans for their part in the "sandpapergate" furore in Cape Town. In a surprise move, Warner will bat at number three with coach Justin Langer sticking with Aaron Finch and Usman Khawaja as his opening pair after the team's recent red-hot form in the lead-up to the World Cup in England. Australia have won eight one-day internationals on the trot. Smith will come on at four with Shaun Marsh at five and Glenn Maxwell left out as Australia won the toss and elected to bowl first in the first of three warm-up games this week at Allan Border Field in Brisbane. Fast bowler Mitchell Starc, who is returning from a muscle tear, was overlooked while Adam Zampa was prefered to Nathan Lyon as the spin option. Teams Australia XI: Aaron Finch, Usman Khawaja, David Warner, Steve Smith, Shaun Marsh, Marcus Stoinis, Alex Carey, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, Jason Behrendorff, Adam Zampa New Zealand XI: George Worker, Henry Nicholls, Will Young, Tom Blundell, Tom Latham, Jimmy Neesham, Daryl Mitchell, Todd Astle, Doug Bracewell, Matt Henry, Hamish Bennett
