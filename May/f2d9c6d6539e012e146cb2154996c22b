Liverpool's Premier League and Champions League challenges suffered a huge blow as Mohamed Salah was stretchered off during their clash with Newcastle with a head knock on Saturday. The Egyptian was caught by Newcastle goalkeeper Martin Dubravka as they challenged for an aerial ball 20 minutes from time. Salah had earlier scored his 26th goal of the season to put Liverpool 2-1 in front at St. James' Park, but Salomon Rondon levelled early in the second-half to make it 2-2. Liverpool host Barcelona in the second leg of their Champions League semi-final on Tuesday, trailing 3-0 from the first leg.
