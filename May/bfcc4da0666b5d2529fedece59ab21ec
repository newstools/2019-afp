Ben Foakes' unbeaten 61 on his debut helped England recover from a top-order collapse to beat Ireland by four wickets in a lone one-day international in Dublin on Friday. England, the world's top-ranked side in ODI cricket and the hosts of the 50-over World Cup starting later this month, collapsed to 66 for five chasing a modest 199 for victory. They were still in trouble at Malahide when teenage debutant left-arm quick Josh Little took his fourth wicket to leave them 101 for six against an Ireland side who have not qualified for the World Cup But wicket-keeper Foakes and Surrey team-mate Tom Curran (47 not out) saw England to victory with an unbroken stand of 98. jdg
