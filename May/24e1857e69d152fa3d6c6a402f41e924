Swansea starlet Daniel James, who has been linked with Manchester United, can advance his case for such a high-profile move after being called up for Wales's Euro 2020 away matches with Croatia and Hungary. The 21-year-old winger missed a training camp in Portugal following the death of his father but Wales manager Ryan Giggs will be expecting him to play a key role against World Cup finalists Croatia and the Hungarians on June 8 and 11 respectively. James sparkled for Swansea in the second-tier Championship last season but with the club wanting to offload players -- having already sold many following relegation from the Premier League last year -- he is seen as one of their cash cows. Wales's one world-class player Gareth Bale will be a little rusty given that he has fallen out of favour with Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane and has not kicked a ball in anger for a month. Giggs, whose side won their opening Group E match against Slovakia, also recalled several players who were involved in the Championship play-off final on Monday. Harry Wilson and Tom Lawrence are called up after missing training camp so they could play in Aston Villa's Championship play-off victory against Derby at Wembley. Liverpool's 19-year-old midfielder Ben Woodburn has been called up despite missing the Portugal trip due to his involvement as a Liverpool squad member in Saturday's Champions League final against Tottenham. Giggs though is without key man, Juventus-bound Aaron Ramsey, who is sidelined with a hamstring injury, and Spurs defender Ben Davies who has a groin issue. Young Manchester United midfielder Dylan Levitt and Barnsley pair Ben Williams and Kieffer Moore earn first call-ups whilst Swansea defender Joe Rodon is the only other uncapped player selected.
