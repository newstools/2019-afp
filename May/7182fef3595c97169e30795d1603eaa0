Renault ace Nico Hulkenberg will start the Spanish Grand Prix from the pit lane after officials hit Renault with a penalty over a non-regulation front wing replacement. Hukenberg crashed in qualifying, damaging the wing, but officials claim the replacement neither conformed to rules and nor were they informed. The German driver had at any rate only qualified to start in 16th position from the eighth row.
