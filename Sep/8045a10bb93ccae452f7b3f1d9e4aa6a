Hur Mi-jung took her place among the LPGA's multiple tournament winners this season, going wire-to-wire for the first time to claim the Indy Women in Tech Championship by four strokes on Sunday. The 29-year-old South Korean entered the final round with a two-stroke lead, having shot a sizzling 63 in her first round to set the tone for the week. Hur just missed a long birdie putt on the final hole, leaving her to tap in for par and a 21-under 261 total at the Brickyard Crossing course. "I am so happy," Hur said. "I was talking about wire-to-wire after third round. I have never done that before so I really wanted to do it, and I did it." Nanna Koerstz Madsen of Denmark birdied her last two holes and shot a closing 67 to finish second on 271. American Marina Alex was third, six strokes adrift, and Japan's Sakura Yokomine, England's Bronte Law, Maria Torres of Puerto Rico and Megan Khang of the US finished in a four-way tie for fourth, eight shots adrift of Hur. "MJ, when she plays good, she's on fire," Koerstz Madsen said. "So I wasn't really thinking that I could catch her. I was thinking she's going to go out and shoot four under or five under or something, so it was going to be really hard if I had to catch her." Hur claimed her fourth career LPGA victory and became one of six multiple winners this season, joining compatriots Ko Jin-young, Kim Sei-young and Park Sung-hyun, Canadian Brooke Henderson and Australia's Hannah Green. She ended a five-year title drought by winning last month's Ladies Scottish Open. Hur started her bogey-free round with three pars before making birdie on the par-four fourth. She recorded back-to-back birdies at the turn and then added another on the par-four 13th hole. "I am just trying to enjoy my golf game. It is working really well," Hur said.
