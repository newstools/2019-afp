Ryu Hyun-jin belted his first home run and pitched seven strong innings as the Los Angeles Dodgers won their 100th game by rallying to beat the Colorado Rockies 7-4 on Sunday. South Korea's Ryu got a five-run fifth inning started with his first career long ball in the final home game of the Major League Baseball regular season for the Dodgers. Cody Bellinger crushed his second grand slam of the season, and his 46th home run overall, as the Dodgers won their 59th home game to go with 22 losses. Dodgers (100-56) reached 100 victories for the second time in the past three seasons and just the fourth time in their Los Angeles history. The Dodgers also reduced their magic number for clinching the best record in the National League to one. Ryu's home run to right-centre field tied the score 1-1 in the fifth and set the stage for Bellinger's heroics. Rockies starting pitcher Antonio Senzatela loaded the bases on a walk to Joc Pederson and singles from Gavin Lux and Justin Turner. Colorado turned to left-hander Jake McGee, but Bellinger crushed his second pitch into the right field seats for his fifth career grand slam. Ryu improved to 13-5 on the season. He gave up three runs on six hits and struck out eight. Garrett Hampson and Sam Hilliard belted home runs for the Rockies. They both have six on the season. Colorado lost for the eighth time in nine games at Dodger Stadium this season. The Dodgers won the season series 15-4.
