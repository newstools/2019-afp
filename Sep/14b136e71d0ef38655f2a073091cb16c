Denmark's Mikkel Bjerg defied a downpour and calls for the race to be halted to win the under-23 world championship time trial in Yorkshire on Tuesday. Berg edged out American duo Ian Garrison and Brandon McNulty in a time of 40min 20.42sec over the 30.3km route from Ripon to Harrogate. However, Bjerg's compatriot and European under-23 time-trial champion Johan Price-Pejtersen was one of those to fall foul of the torrential rain. Price-Pejtersen suffered a spectacular crash as he came around a bend at speed and directly into deep standing water which threw him from his bike. "I think it was a bit extreme," said Price-Pejtersen. "In my opinion I think they should have cancelled it for a bit, until at least the pools had gone and the rain had stopped being so extreme." The UCI was continuing to monitor conditions to ensure that the women's elite time trial, due to start at 2.50pm local time (1350 GMT), could safely be staged.
