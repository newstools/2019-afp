The defending World Series champion Boston Red Sox fired president Dave Dombrowski Sunday night, following a 10-5 loss to the New York Yankees, ESPN reported. The move comes less than a year after Boston beat the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games in the 2018 World Series. The struggling Red Sox have 76 wins and 67 losses and are now 17 1/2 games back of New York for first place in the AL East and falling further out of the playoff picture. Dombrowski was considered the main architect of the Red Sox's fourth championship in 15 years. Dombrowski will be replaced by assistant general manager Eddie Romero after failing in the offseason to improve the team, particularly the bullpen. The Red Sox also lost closing pitcher Craig Kimbrel in the offseason. Since his hiring in August 2015, Dombrowski was known for bringing in Alex Cora as manager and trading for pitchers Chris Sale and Craig Kimbrel. He also engineered the signings of J.D. Martinez and David Price.
