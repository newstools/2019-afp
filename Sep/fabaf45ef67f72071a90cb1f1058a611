Canadian teenager Bianca Andreescu said Saturday's US Open final victory over 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams was a "dream come true". The 19-year-old defeated six-time US Open winner Williams 6-3, 7-5 to become Canada's first Grand Slam singles champion, and the youngest Slam titlist since Maria Sharapova in 2006. "Itâ€™s so hard to explain in words but I'm just beyond grateful and truly blessed. I've worked really, really hard for this moment," Andreescu said. "This year has been a dream come true. Being able to play on this stage against Serena, a true legend of the sport, is amazing. "It wasn't easy at all. I tried to prepare my best like I do every match, I tried not to focus on who I'm playing. I'm really proud of how I dealt with everything." Her triumph at Flushing Meadows capped a remarkable 12 months for 15th seed Andreescu, who was ranked outside the top 200 this time last year after falling short in US Open qualifying for the second season in a row. "Last year wasn't an easy period in my life with injuries but I persevered and told myself not to give up," she said. "I just keep telling myself keep working hard and keep the momentum. Hopefully I can keep going."
