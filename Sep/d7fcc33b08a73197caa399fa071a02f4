The NFL has entered into a deal to make DraftKings the century-old league's first official daily fantasy partner, the league and company announced Thursday. Terms of the partnership give the DraftKings sports platform "exclusive sponsorship of the daily fantasy sports category with access to NFL branding and more" according to a statement. "Daily fantasy football has been a tremendous vehicle for fans of all types to deepen their engagement with the NFL," said Renie Anderson, chief revenue officer and executive vice president of NFL Partnerships. "We're thrilled to partner with DraftKings, a clear leader in the daily fantasy space, as they continue to innovate and provide our millions of fans additional ways to interact with and enjoy the NFL." DraftKings has a global player base of over 11 million people, with nearly 90 percent of DraftKings customers having participated in an NFL daily fantasy contest. "This is a defining moment in the industry and we are thrilled to become the first daily fantasy sports partner to enter into a formal relationship with the NFL," DraftKings chief executive Jason Robins said. "Throughout our discussions with the league, it was evident we share a common vision around the future of fan engagement and we are excited to continue on this unique journey with the NFL."
