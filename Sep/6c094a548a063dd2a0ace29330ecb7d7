Oakland Raiders receiver Antonio Brown is facing a suspension after a furious bust-up with general manager Mike Mayock, multiple reports said Thursday. Brown was involved in a heated confrontation with Mayock after the receiver complained of being hit with fines for missing a practice and walkthrough. ESPN reported that Brown would be suspended by the Raiders over the incident. The NFL Network reported that Brown had threatened to punch Mayock during the practice field face-off. The news of a possible suspension marked the latest in a series of off-field dramas that have swirled around Brown since he was traded to the Raiders by the Pittsburgh Steelers in March. The 31-year-old seven-time Pro-Bowler was forced to miss two weeks of training camp in August after reporting for duty with frostbite on his feet, which he blamed on a cryotherapy mishap. He also vented angrily against the NFL over new regulations forcing players in the league to switch to a new type of helmet, insisting he be allowed to retain the helmet he has always played with. His attempts to force the league into granting an exemption for him on the helmet issue ended in failure.
