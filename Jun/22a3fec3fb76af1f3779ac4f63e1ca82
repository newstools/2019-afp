England's netball head coach Tracey Neville will step down after next month's World Cup in Liverpool, but hopes to one day return to the role after starting a family. Neville, sister of former Manchester United captain Gary and coach of England's women's football team Phil Neville, was appointed four years ago, leading the Roses to bronze at the 2015 World Cup in Australia. Since then she has inspired an even greater upturn as England shocked hosts Australia to win the 2018 Commonwealth Games gold medal. That success saw England's netballers win sporting moment and team of the year in the BBC's sports personality awards in December, while Neville was nominated in the best coach category. "Being the head coach is something I have relished and I am extremely proud to have had the opportunity to do," said Neville in a statement. "Over the last few months I have sat down with England Netball to look at how I could fulfil my role whilst taking into consideration my personal circumstances. My ambition to have a family is something I want to commit to after the Netball World Cup. "The Rosesâ€™ future is paramount in my thoughts and plans and I will passionately and wholeheartedly continue to support them and England Netball. I will hopefully get an opportunity to lead again in the future."
