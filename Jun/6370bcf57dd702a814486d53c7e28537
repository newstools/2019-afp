Rain delayed the start of the World Cup match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Bristol on Friday, with a bleak forecast including the potential of thundery downpours. The game was due to start at 10:30 am (0930 GMT) but large areas of the playing area were covered under dark skies. Both Pakistan and Sri Lanka bounced back after opening defeats. Pakistan lost to the West Indies by seven wickets at Trent Bridge before beating England by 14 runs at the same venue on Monday. Sri Lanka crashed to a 10-wicket defeat against New Zealand before pulling off a 34-run win against Afghanistan in a rain-affected game. All 10 teams play each other in a round-robin format, with the top four qualifying for the semi-finals.
