Gary Woodland seized the US Open lead at eight-under par with three holes to play on Friday, back-to-back birdies pushing him past England's Justin Rose. Rose was in the clubhouse on seven-under 135 after a second-round 70. The world number four's lead had held up for hours as the likes of four-time major winner Rory McIlroy and former British Open champion Louis Oosthuizen tried and failed to supplant him. Woodland, a 35-year-old three-time winner on the US PGA Tour, teed off on 10 and was bogey-free with five birdies through 15 holes. He rolled in a 15-foot birdie putt at the par-five fifth, then reached the  green at the par-five sixth in two, where he two-putted from 21 feet. Elsewhere among the late starters, McIlroy had five birdies to offset a bogey and a double-bogey in a two-under 69 for a five-under total of 137, tied with Aaron Wise.
