Experienced pair Mathieu Bastareaud and Morgan Parra missed out on France's 31-man World Cup squad, head coach Jacques Brunel announced on Tuesday. Scrum-half Parra, 30, featured at both the 2011 and 2015 World Cups, but has been suffering from an ankle injury sustained while playing for club side Clermont last month. Centre Bastareaud, also 30, has captained Les Bleus in the absence of regular skipper Guilhem Guirado in recent seasons, and was also a member of the France team that were hammered by New Zealand in the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Cup. There is also no space for fleet-footed Racing 92 winger Teddy Thomas nor for La Rochelle's giant prop Uini Atonio. Uncapped front rowers Peato Mauvaka and Emerick Setiano as well as Fijian-born winger Alivereti Raka are included in the squad for the first time. Seven members of Toulouse's Top 14-winning side are named including centre Sofiane Guitoune whose last cap came during the 2015 tournament. Brunel also announced a six-man reserve list as back-up in case of injuries which includes flanker Francois Cros, who is yet to feature on the international stage. Les Bleus start their campaign against Argentina on September 21 before facing the USA, Tonga and then England in what promises to be a tough Pool C.
