Bangladesh missed a chance to strike a blow against Australia when David Warner was dropped early in their World Cup match at Trent Bridge on Thursday. After the 10-over powerplay, reigning champions Australia were 53 without loss. Australia captain Aaron Finch, who won the toss, was 24 not out and Warner unbeaten on 26. But left-hander Warner had made just 10 when a slashing cut off Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza burst through the hands of Sabbir Rahman at backward point, with the fielder not appearing to see the ball properly against the backdrop of the crowd. Warner later cashed in by hooking left-arm fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman for six. Finch, fresh from his 153 in an 87-run win over Sri Lanka, had previously launched Mashrafe -- the only survivor on either side from Bangladesh's shock 2005 one-day international win over Australia in Cardiff -- for a huge six over cover. Australia are currently third in the table, with four wins from five games. Bangladesh, following their impressive seven-wicket win over the West Indies, are fifth. The top four sides from the 10-team round-robin stage qualify for the semi-finals.
