Reigning champions Australia suffered a dramatic top-order collapse in a World Cup match against the West Indies as they slumped to 38 for four amid a barrage of bouncers at Trent Bridge on Thursday. The West Indies shot out Pakistan for just 105 with aggressive short-pitched fast bowling when winning their tournament opener at Nottinghamshire's headquarters last week. Unsurprisingly, they adopted similar tactics after captain Jason Holder won the toss on a sunny day. Oshane Thomas struck first when Australia captain Aaron Finch (six) edged a straight lifting delivery and was caught behind. David Warner (eight) was next to fall when, one ball after a bouncer, he was caught at backward point slashing at a length delivery from Sheldon Cottrell that saw the former soldier celebrate the wicket with his trademark salute. Australia were now 21 for two, with Warner booed off the field and new batsman Steve Smith booed on to it as a result of the pair's involvement in a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa last year that saw both star batsmen receive 12-month bans. Usman Khawaja, hit on the grille by Andre Russell in a warm-up match, was twice struck on the body by short-pitched deliveries on Thursday. He fell for 13 to all-rounder Russell's sixth ball when a loose drive took the outside edge and diving wicket-keeper Shai Hope held a brilliant low one-handed catch. And Australia's 36 for three was quickly transformed into 38 for four when Glenn Maxwell was out for a second-ball duck, a top-edged skyed hook off a Cottrell bouncer comfortably held by Hope. Left-armer Cottrell had figures of two for 11 from his first four overs as Australia, who beat minnows Afghanistan in their first match, looked to Smith and Marcus Stoinis to rebuild the innings.
