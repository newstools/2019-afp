Gary Woodland maintained a two-shot lead over Justin Rose through nine holes of the US Open third round Saturday at Pebble Beach, where the big-hitting American had moved to 10-under. Woodland, a three-time US PGA Tour winner in search of his first major title, stretched his lead to as many as four after birdies at the fourth and sixth put him at 11-under while Rose remained at seven-under after a birdie at the fourth and a bogey at the fifth. The gap was back to two, however, after Woodland bogeyed the eighth and Rose birdied to reach eight-under. Meanwhile, two-time defending champion Brooks Koepka was staying in touch in his bid to become just the second player -- and the first in more than a century -- to win a third straight US Open. Koepka had three birdies without a bogey to stand at seven-under through 11 holes. Americans Matt Kuchar and Chesson Hadley were six-under, Kuchar moving as low as eight-under before back-to-back bogeys at the eighth and ninth. Tiger Woods, who began the day nine shots off the pace on even par, was unable to make headway, finishing with five birdies and five bogeys to remain even for the tournament.
