Williams chief technical officer Paddy Lowe will not return to the struggling Formula One team after his departure was confirmed on Tuesday. Lowe had been on a leave of absence since the week before the F1 season got underway after a series of production issues delayed the roll-out of the new FW42 for pre-season testing. That followed a bitterly disappointing 2018 season that saw Williams finish last in the constructors' championship. "After a period of careful reflection I have reached the decision that I will not return to work at Williams," said Lowe in a team statement. Williams are the only team yet to register a point in this season's championship after eight races. The British team, which has won nine constructors' and seven drivers' world titles, has drafted in co-founder and former technical chief Patrick Head on a consultancy basis.
